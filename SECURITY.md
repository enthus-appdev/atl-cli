# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/enthus-appdev/atl-cli/security/advisories/new) rather than opening a public issue.

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to provide a fix or mitigation plan within 7 days.

## Scope

This policy covers the atl-cli codebase. Issues with the Atlassian APIs themselves should be reported to Atlassian directly.
